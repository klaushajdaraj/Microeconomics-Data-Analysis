# Microeconomics Analysis

This project includes an empirical analysis on demand elasticities using Instrumental Regression as Identification Strategy using R.
The focus of the project is analysing the data and making conclusions in elasticity for demand.
Demand Elasticity has a great importance for determining prices of various factors of production. Factors of production are paid according to their elasticity of demand. In other words, if the demand of a factor is inelastic, its price will be high and if it is elastic, its price will be low.
